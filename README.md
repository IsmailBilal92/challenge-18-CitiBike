# challenge-18-CitiBike

Summery of my work: 
I came up with an idea to study the 3 months summer for 2023: 
•	Upload 4 csv file for June, July, August, and September.
•	Use Jupyter notebook to clean and organize data. 
•	Upload my data to Tableau.
Note: My work may not be enough for this challenge, but I was trying to see if I can come with an idea and use all the tools to answer my own question too.  Time was short to do more since I spend long time on cleaning data and create each sheet in tableau. Hope you guys will like my work. 
I wish I can have details feedback on my work to see my weaknesses and wok on it. 
Here is my work:
